ALGORITHM №1 FOR 1 vs 1

Passing the group stage (TOP-24)

1. From the groups consisting of 4 fighters – 2 fighters from 1st and 2nd places pass to the next tour.

2. Fighters on the 21-24th places go on to the next tour depending on the overall rating.

IMPORTANT NOTE:   If there are more than 1 fighter for the 24th place with equal rating (e.g. fighters on the 24, 25, 26 places have the same rating), then lot is cast in the presence of Marshal.

ALGORITHM №2 FOR 1 vs 1

Principles of 1st 1/8 standings formation

8 of 24 fighters pass directly to the 2nd 1/8 stage. That’s why there are 16 fighters left for 1st 1/8 standings formation.

1. 16 fighters pass to the 1st 1/8 from the group stage.

2. Fighters are assigned to the nominal symbols: Winner (W), Runner-up (R), Joker (J) according to their place in the list of passed fighters of their group using the next principle:

•             1st passed fighter from the group list – Winner;

•             2nd passed fighter from the group list – Runner-up;

•             Fighters that passed from the 21-24 places – Joker.

Therefore, 10 winners, 2 runner-ups, 4 jokers are assigned.

3. The number of winners equalizes with the sum of R+J. To achieve this, 2 winners with lowest rating are assigned as R*. Therefore, we get 8 winners and 8 fighters, who are nominally lower in rating (R,J,R*). If more than 2 winners have the same rating, than nominal symbol W is assigned to the fighter that was in the group with lower index number.

4. Principle of the 1st 1/8 web forming is based on the so-called “backmixing”, i.e. W from the 1st to 8th are placed with R, J, R* from the 8th to 1st. You can see an example of backmixing lower:

Duel #                                 

№1        W1         vs           J8

№2        W2         vs           R7*

№3        W3         vs           R6

№4        W4         vs           J5

№5        W5         vs           R4

№6        W6         vs           R3*

№7        W7         vs           R2

№8        W8         vs           R1

IMPORTANT NOTE:     1. During 1st 1/8 works “move our group further” rule.

2. During 1st 1/8 works “move our country further” rule.

Both rules work by the similar principle, which is described in “Additional rules” file.

ALGORITHM №3 FOR 1 vs 1

Principles of 2nd 1/8 standings formation

1. TOP-8 fighters from the Group Stage are already in 2nd 1/8. They stand into battles according to rating (From TOP-1 to TOP-8) and wait for the rivals. If fighters from TOP-8 have the same rating, than higher in the schedule stands fighter who was in the group with lower index number.

TOP-1   vs          

ТОP-2   vs          

ТОP-3   vs          

ТОP-4   vs          

ТОP-5   vs          

ТОP-6   vs          

ТОP-7   vs          

ТОP-8   vs          

2. Winners of the 1st 1/8 are placed versus waiting fighters of TOP-8 by “backmixing” principle.

ТОP-1   vs           W(№8)

ТОP-2   vs           W(№7)

ТОP-3   vs           W(№6)

ТОP-4   vs           W(№5)

ТОP-5   vs           W(№4)

ТОP-6   vs           W(№3)

ТОP-7   vs           W(№2)

ТОP-8   vs           W(№1)

IMPORTANT NOTE:  1. During 2nd 1/8 works ONLY “move our country further” rule.
