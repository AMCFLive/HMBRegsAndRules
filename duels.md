## 2. AUTHENTIC EQUIPMENT

 2.1. Only those arms and armor, which have analogues of a certain historical period, confirmed by scientific research, are allowed in HMB.

 2.2. A fighter has to rebate his weapons before the participation in an event and bring them into conformity with the specifications stated in this regulatory document.

  Rebating is rounding of peak and percussion edges of any bladed or pole weapon used in HMB competitions. The radius of rebating is about 10 mm (note: it has to match the radius of a coin 20 mm in diameter).

  2.2.1. The edges of all the striking parts of any weapon are to be rounded as a bevel and be not less than 2 mm thick (including any possible chips and notches).

  2.2.2. The edges of shields are to be trimmed with thick (not less than 2-4 mm) leather or three or more layers of fabric attached with glue.

   a) Important! All wooden, wicker or leather shields have be made only on the basis of reliable historical analogues and correspond to the form of the analogue in all three planes. A shield can only be used with a set of armor of the same epoch and region.

  2.2.3. Edges of the iron shields have to be carefully forge-rolled and be no less than 4 mm thick.

   a) Important! Allowed metal shields must have only round shapes, made on the basis of reliable historical analogues corresponding to the form of the analogue in all three planes. A shield can only be used with a set of armor of the same epoch and region. The weight of any metal shield shall not exceed 5 kg.

 2.3. All the responsibility for the quality, safety and reliability of the elements of protective arms lies on the fighter who uses them.

 2.4. The approved protective arms for HMB competitions must be a reconstruction of medieval armor (must have the exact proportions and general appearance of historical analogue) and correspond to such characteristics:

  - compliance with scientifically proved originals of the XIII- XVIIth centuries;
  - authenticity of used materials (metal, leather, fabric, tow, batting, felt);
  - availability of configuration that completely covers the vital organs and joints of the fighter;
  - good condition;
  - thickness of protective material has to meet the requirements (stated below);
  - size and proportions of all the protective elements have to meet the requirements;
  - aesthetic appearance.

 2.5. All items of armor have to meet the technical and aesthetic requirements, and represent a complete set of one time period within 50 years.

  a) Important! Only in rare cases, due to the lack of information concerning the material culture of certain periods and regions, stylized armor elements are allowed. In this situation, a fighter can replace these items with the authentic elements, relating to the neighboring regions and periods, but only if everything looks aesthetically and proportionally. Concepts that require further interpretation and explanation:

   1. Authentic means material or object that corresponds to a certain historical original, found during the research. The use of authentic materials and items, coming from the original, is approved by the community of historical reenactors of the Middle Ages.

   2. Stylized item is an object that has no specific historical analogues, but is made in compliance with the general style of armor, its proportional, aesthetic and operational characteristics.

   3. Scientifically proved original is text and visual material (pictures, sculptures, and other documented archaeological sources or their combination), on the basis of which a belonging of a particular object to the group of authentic ones is determined. Scientifically proved original is needed in case a reenactor has an intention to start usage of anything radically new or little known in the community of HRMA. Only the scientifically proved original can help to determine whether an object is authentic or not, to make a decision about the possibility of its use in the HRMA circles.

  2.5.1. The fighter’s head has to be protected with a metal helmet, safety features and specifications of which comply with the same parameters of a helmet made of steel ST3 2 mm thick.

  2.5.6. The neck and base of the skull are to be protected with metal plate-armor element, supplemented with damping quilted or padded protection, such as a pelerine of the padded cap, a special collar or a filling. A riveted chain-mail element, with the plate protection and a protective damping layer located under it, is allowed.

  2.5.7. The spine and tailbone should have metal plate protection with quilted or padded protection not less than 10 mm thick in a condensed form.

  2.5.9. Hands and forearms of a fighter using a shield with the elbow grip can be protected with metal armor elements. Then, if a fighter loses the shield, he’ll be able to continue the fight.

The minimum level of underarmor protection includes layers of woolen and linen cloth sewn together.

  2.5.10.The fighter’s elbows and knees must have a metal plate protection. If the plate protection doesn’t fit the fighter’s armor, it should be hidden under the authentic element of the set.
